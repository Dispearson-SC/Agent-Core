# Operations

Procedures an operator runs by hand. Each one names the command, what it reads, and what it
changes. Decisions behind them are in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Bumping the DBOS application version

`composition.PINNED_DBOS_APPLICATION_VERSION` (currently `agent-core-turns.3`) is bumped when a
change makes turns that are already in flight incompatible with the new code: a workflow step
added, removed, renamed or reordered, or a changed workflow argument (D28 took `.1` to `.2`;
D31 took `.2` to `.3`: the peer job gained `answer_token` and the round gained the cancel
cascade steps. Peer asks in flight on `.2` are stranded too: `stranded-turns` lists them, and
their mailbox rows stay `delivered` until the lease in D31 reclaims them under `.3`).

DBOS recovers a PENDING workflow only when its row names the version the recovering process
claims. After a bump, a turn that was suspended under the old version (waiting for a person or
for a peer) is **not** recovered and **not** failed: it stays `PENDING` for ever. Because
`agent-core-turns` runs one turn at a time per session, it also blocks every later turn of that
conversation. Nothing raises.

### 1. Before the deploy: see what is open

```bash
python -m agent_core stranded-turns
```

Run it with the **old** build's settings to see what is in flight now, and with the **new**
build after the deploy to see what the bump stranded. It reads the DBOS system database
(`<app database>_dbos_sys`, table `dbos.workflow_status`) with one SELECT. It does not launch
DBOS, does not recover anything and writes nothing.

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | no open workflow (`PENDING`, `ENQUEUED`, `DELAYED`) under a version other than the one this build claims |
| 1 | stranded workflows were listed (id, status, version, queue, age) |
| 2 | the check could not run (system database unreachable); never read this as clean |

### 2. Drain (preferred)

Before the deploy, stop new traffic and let the in-flight turns finish: people decide their
approvals, peers answer, or the turn expires on its own (`THREE_DAYS` for a person, the asker's
`reply_timeout_seconds` for a peer). Run the check against the old build until it reports 0
open turns, then deploy.

### 3. Cancel what is left (after the deploy, or when draining is not possible)

A stranded turn will never resume into the new code, and replaying it against a different step
sequence is exactly what the bump exists to prevent. Cancel it so its session's slot is freed:

```bash
python -m agent_core stranded-turns          # note the workflow ids
dbos workflow cancel <workflow_id> \
  --sys-db-url "<system database url, i.e. the app url with _dbos_sys appended to the database>"
```

`dbos workflow list --status PENDING --application-version <old version> --sys-db-url ...`
lists the same rows. The person or the asking agent waiting on a cancelled turn gets no reply;
tell them to ask again. Run `stranded-turns` once more: it must exit 0.

Do **not** edit `dbos.workflow_status` by hand and do **not** set
`AGENT_CORE_DBOS_APPLICATION_VERSION` back to the old value to "recover" them against changed
code.
